✅ SESSION NOT FOUND ERROR - FIXED

WHAT WAS WRONG:
- When users sent messages with non-existent session IDs, API returned 404 error
- Error message: "Session not found"

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- File: chatbot/views.py (Lines 102-117, 178-186)
- Changed from .get() to .get_or_create()
- Sessions now auto-create if they don't exist
- No more "Session not found" errors

HOW TO TEST:
1. Start server: python manage.py runserver
2. Visit: http://localhost:8000/chatbot/
3. Send a message - should work without errors
4. Refresh page - session should persist
5. Send another message - should add to history

KEY CHANGES:
✅ send_message() - Uses get_or_create for automatic session handling
✅ get_history() - Returns empty history instead of error for non-existent sessions
✅ Single code path - No more if/else complexity
✅ Better UX - Seamless conversation experience

STATUS: READY TO USE
